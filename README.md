# aishell

**aishell** is a smart shell designed to enhance your command-line experience. It remembers long command histories and can intelligently offer the best command suggestions, triggered by user prompts or through auto-complete. This helps streamline repetitive tasks, reduces command errors, and boosts productivity by surfacing the most relevant commands exactly when you need them.

It uses vector DB (chromadb for example) to store and search command history.

Also, plan to support agent running at background as well to finish some long-running tasks.
